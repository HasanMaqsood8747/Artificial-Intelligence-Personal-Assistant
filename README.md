# Artificial-Intelligence-Personal-Assistant
I developed a Desktop Application i.e. Artificial Intelligence Personal Assistant. This application is developed using Python, Tkinter & using Python libraries & APIs. This Project uses the Speech Recognition & Natural Language Processing to convert the user’s voice to text & after that responds to user’s instruction in voice. This virtual assistant will enable users to perform a range of tasks through voice commands, such as retrieving information, sending emails, sending WhatsApp messages, providing weather updates, searching on Google, searching on Wikipedia, opening any YouTube video, telling the current Date & Time, telling latest News and more.
